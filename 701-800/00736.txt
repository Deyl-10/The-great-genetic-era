Chapter 736 - 736 Zhao Hailong’S Question

736 Zhao Hailong’s Question

To be able to enter the Huaxia Genetic Evolution College, they were already elites among the students. Furthermore, they had stood out from the tens of thousands of students in the Huaxia Genetic Evolution College and were accepted into the Extraterrestrial Genetic Evolution College. They were definitely geniuses.

Furthermore, they were all geniuses with exceptional intelligence.

Everyone was only surprised that Xu Tui would suddenly announce that he would not join either of the Huaxia Sector’s special forces. They only quietly listened to what Xu Tui had to say.

Zhao Hailong and Luo Murong’s gazes shifted. They had already realized something. After all, if they did not join the special forces of the Huaxia Sector, they would not be able to join the special forces of the Huaya Sector, much less join the special forces of the other sectors.

“I’ve actually been thinking about this for more than ten days before making a prudent decision today. In the extra-terrestrial, I trusted my comrades more and my strength more. Therefore, I finally decided not to join either of the special forces. However, it was impossible to participate in the space invasion alone.

“I’m prepared to form a small-scale special force to participate in the space invasion battle later. It’s actually a special combat team. My goal in the special forces is very simple. I want to obtain cultivation resources and improve together with them to contribute to the Huaxia Sector. That’s all.

“Currently, I am the only one in this special force. The initial plan was for me to be the commander. Now, I’ll advertise for everyone.”

Xu Tui made a joke and relaxed. “I’ll see if anyone here is willing to form a special force with me.

“Let me make it clear first that my special force is a start-up. Currently, there are no benefits or rules. You can come and go voluntarily. Everyone, if anyone can take a fancy to me, Xu Tui, and form this special force with me to participate in the invasion, I will be very happy.

“It’s alright if everyone here is unwilling to take the risk with me. Furthermore, this choice will not affect our relationship. We will still be comrades and classmates. There will be plenty of opportunities to fight side by side in the future.”

Xu Tui had completed his recruitment declaration. He had thought that there would be an awkward silence. Someone would definitely ask him many questions before joining.

Xu Tui did not expect that the moment he finished speaking, Li Zheng, who came later, would be the first to speak. “Xu Tui, I’ll join your special forces if you don’t mind my strength. A month ago, I just broke through to the Genetic Evolution Realm!” Li Zheng said.

Everyone’s gazes shifted. They did not expect Li Zheng to have broken through to the Genetic Evolution Realm. However, it was not strange. Li Zheng was already in her fourth year. It was normal for her to break through to the Genetic Evolution Realm.

This cultivation speed was much faster than her uncle, Li Zhen.

Li Zheng’s determined expression and the fact that she was the first to speak surprised everyone.

“I will definitely participate in Xu Tui’s special force.” Yan Lie was the second to express his stance. “However, Li Zheng, didn’t you already receive an invitation from an official member of the Haotian Special Force? Why?”

Yan Lie was more familiar with Li Zheng. He raised his doubts on the spot.

A hint of shame and anger appeared on Li Zheng’s slightly chubby face. “They gave me the official membership of the Haotian Special Force. However, he arranged for me to be beside Commander Ruan Da and be his assistant!”

There was an instant silence in the private room. Only Cui Xi, who had always been rough, said suspiciously, “Assistant to the commander, this is a good thing. If you join, you’ll…” Before he could finish speaking, Cui Xi suddenly reacted and slammed the table on the spot. “Damn it! Who do they think you are? Did they arrange it just like that?”

Li Zheng bit her lip and looked at Xu Tui. “Xu Tui, if you’re afraid of trouble, forget it.”

Xu Tui did not expect the female experts in the extra-terrestrial to be so popular. Li Zheng had just broken through to the Genetic Evolution Realm and wanted to join the Haotian Special Force, but she had already been reserved by Commander Ruan Da. Although it was not explicit, the meaning was clear.

If Li Zheng broke through to the Genetic Transmutation Realm in the future, she would be Ruan Da’s best match.

In fact, under similar circumstances, Ruan Da and even Ruan Tianzuo, who was behind Ruan Da, would do their best to nurture Li Zheng to break through to the Genetic Transmutation Realm.

Ruan Da immediately arranged for Li Zheng to be beside him as the regiment commander. He had the intention of marking and protecting her. However, this was almost a humiliation to Li Zheng, who was also a proud daughter of heaven.

“What trouble can there be? You’re just rejecting their invitation. You’re not the first. In that case, I already have two official members,” Xu Tui said with a smile.

“Eh, I’ll be the third one.” Cui Xi rushed to speak.

“I’ll go with Sister Zheng. I’m the fourth one,” Yan Xuejin said.

“Hah, I’m the fifth. In my memory, the battle of the Mars crater is still fierce. If I have the chance, I want to charge forward with Xu Tui again,” Miao Huanshan said with a smile.

“Get lost. You’re the only one who knows how to talk nonsense!” Cui Xi scolded jokingly.

“Xu Tui, if you don’t mind, I’ll join too,” Tao Guan said softly.

“We’re all classmates. What happened in the past was just an exchange in school.” Xu Tui let the matter rest.

Xu Tui looked at Zhao Hailong and Luo Murong. Among everyone present, these two people were the strongest. If one of them joined, Xu Tui’s strength would increase greatly. Of course, even if the two of them did not join, Xu Tui’s special force would still take shape.

However, when they participated in the space invasion, their tactics would be a little more conservative.

“Count me in! I only have one request. You have to be hygienic!” Luo Murong’s words stunned everyone. This request was really extraordinary.

“Cui Xi, I’m talking about you. You have to use the serving chopsticks when picking up food! Didn’t you notice that I’ve never picked up any of the dishes you picked up?”

Cui Xi was stunned. He said nonchalantly, “Isn’t it troublesome to use the serving chopsticks? We’re all brothers who have risked our lives together. Are you afraid…”

“Let’s go and train!” Luo Murong stood up and held his golden saber.

“This… I don’t need the serving chopsticks. I can use my energy field to pick up food…”

“Let’s go and train now!”

Cui Xi: “…”

Xu Tui: “…”

“I can’t beat you. I’ll use the serving chopsticks! Forget it, it’s troublesome. This plate belongs to me. I won’t eat the other dishes!” Cui Xi picked up a row of stewed steak and poured it onto his plate.

“Hey, damn! I still want to eat!” Miao Huanshan, who loved to eat, became anxious.

“If you’re not convinced, let’s go and train.” Cui Xi chuckled. He had learned from Luo Murong. Miao Huanshan immediately withered.

“Hygiene? Alright, we’ll work hard to be hygienic in the future!”

Xu Tui patted his head with a headache. Why did he feel that he had taken in a few children? At this moment, everyone except Zhao Hailong had announced that they had joined Xu Tui’s special forces. When everyone looked over, Zhao Hailong slowly spoke.

“I believe in Xu Tui’s strength, and I believe in his character even more. I will definitely be more at ease in his special forces than in other people’s special forces. However, I have a problem that I urgently need to solve. It’s also more contradictory at the moment. This is also the reason why I’m hesitating,” Zhao Hailong said.

“Hailong, I support whatever choice you make!” Xu Tui was the first to express his stance. “Of course, you can tell me about your problem. I’ll see if the problem can be resolved.”

Zhao Hailong was still very powerful. He could attack in close-range and long-range, and he could defend. His strength was very comprehensive. Since he had decided to form a special force, Xu Tui had to make his special force stronger.

“Some cultivation problems! The reason why I chose the Taiyi Special Forces last year is that official members of the Taiyi Special Forces have the right to ask questions as long as they participate in the battle and make contributions.

“Captain Li Shihua would pass the unanswerable cultivation questions to his uncles, friends, and even planetary-level powerhouses like his father to solve the questions for him. My teacher in the genetic ancient martial arts passed away last year. I had just broken through to the Genetic Evolution Realm this year. I had a few cultivation doubts that I could not solve.

“Therefore, I was a little hesitant. If I became a member of the Taiyi Special Forces this year and made contributions in this year’s invasion, according to the rules of the Taiyi Special Forces, I would be able to invite at least a quasi-planetary-level powerhouse to enlighten me.

“My previous plan was to take you as the leader and join a special force to obtain more rights and benefits. I didn’t expect you to form a team. However, my cultivation problem is really a little difficult for me now,” Zhao Hailong said with a bitter smile.

As Xu Tui nodded, everyone present looked at Xu Tui. Actually, this was also a problem that everyone would face in the future. He had not thought about this just now. Now that Zhao Hailong mentioned it, he felt a little worried. Actually, this was also one of the greatest benefits of the other special forces.

...

“This… Hailong, it’s like this. You can send me your cultivation problem. I’ll forward it to my teachers and see if they can help you solve it.”

Although Zhao Hailong hesitated, he was open and aboveboard. He directly asked his question.

Xu Tui had to fight for it if he could.

“Your teacher, Professor An Xiaoxue? Although she is very knowledgeable, she is only at the Mystery Branch Genetic Evolution Realm. I’m afraid…” Zhao Hailong smiled bitterly again.

“No, I still have two teachers,” Xu Tui said.

“There’s more?”

“Mr. Ji and Mr. He! If not for the fact that I can’t contact Mr. Shang now, I can help you contact Mr. Shang,” Xu Tui said.

Before Zhao Hailong could understand who Mr. Ji, Mr. He, and Mr. Shang were, Li Zheng exclaimed. “Xu Tui, are you talking about Mr. Ji Guoliang, Mr. He Yunfeng, and Senior Shang Long?”

A person’s name was like a tree’s shadow. This time, Zhao Hailong immediately reacted. “Is it Ji Qianli and He Wanjian?”

“That’s right. They are all my teachers of Genetic Miracles,” Xu Tui said.

“You can contact them anytime?” Zhao Hailong asked, puzzled.

...

“Of course. I just got off the phone with them yesterday.”

Zhao Hailong was stunned.

“Damn, two quasi-planetary-level and one planetary-level. Xu Tui, you are not their child. If you were their child, you would be a genetic nouveau riche!” Cui Xi exclaimed.

“You’re the one they gave birth to!” Xu Tui glared at Cui Xi.

“I wish!”

“I have two cultivation problems. Can you help me now…” Halfway through his sentence, Zhao Hailong suddenly stopped. “There’s no hurry! I’ll join. When I participate in this space invasion and make a contribution,

“Xu Tui, help me ask the two seniors for guidance.”

“Send me the questions. I’ll ask them now. There are not so many twists and turns between us brothers,” Xu Tui said directly.

Zhao Hailong was still hesitant. “Is that appropriate?”

“What’s inappropriate?”

A minute later, Xu Tui forwarded Zhao Hailong’s question to Mr. Ji Guoliang. Xu Tui felt that it was better to let Mr. Ji answer it. He felt that Mr. He was not too reliable.

“Oh, yes, the name. The name of the special force!” Li Zheng shouted. She looked even more excited than Xu Tui.

“Dali Special Forces!” Cui Xi assumed a Popeye posture.

“Let’s call it the Huaxia Dragon Special Forces!” Yan Lie suggested.

“That won’t do. It’ll be too hateful,” Xu Tui quickly rejected.

“Let’s call it the Worldly Special Forces.” Xu Tui had already decided. At this moment, Xu Tui’s communication device beeped. “I received a reply from Mr. Ji. Hailong, I’ll transfer it to you. See if it’s useful.”

A few minutes later, Zhao Hailong, who had been stunned for a long time, instantly stood up and rushed out like lightning when he saw Ji Qianli’s reply. He had just rushed out when he turned back. “The problem that has been troubling me for half a year has been resolved. I feel that I can break through again now. I’ll leave first. By the way, call me if you need anything!”@@novelbin@@

In the next moment, Zhao Hailong disappeared like a whirlwind. This scene made the others look sideways. Wasn’t the efficiency of contacting a quasi-planetary-level powerhouse too high?
