Chapter 194: More and More Precious Knowledge

“Brother Xu, the registration is complete. Your challenge information has entered the challenge pool. The first challenge is a random selection.

“Number 19, code name Huang Tianba. The 10,000-yuan deposit would be deducted if you did not appear on time or had age problems.

“In addition, the people who come to the martial arts arena here will not show their faces to others. There are various masks and bionic masks provided here. They cost 1,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan respectively. You can choose one.” Zhuang Ziqiang casually projected the choice of the mask for Xu Tui.

...

“Do all of them wear it?”

“More or less. It’s also a way to reduce the trouble. Although the way they attack will still expose their true identities, most people don’t have the ability to do so. Of course, there won’t be any trouble on normal occasions.” Zhuang Ziqiang said.

“I’m still young, so I’ll choose something… a little more handsome. This then. This is a silver mask and it’s a bionic one. It can’t affect my battles,” Xu Tui said.

“I need a little bit of your facial data.”

Zhuang Ziqiang quickly collected some data from Xu Tui’s eyes, such as the distance between his eyes, and sent it over. Then, he asked again, “Brother Xu, other than the appearance fee, you chose this place because you wanted to bet on the profits, right? That’s the only way to get a bigger profit, right?”

Xu Tui nodded. That was true. He might be able to earn nearly a million yuan in a night just by paying the appearance fee. However, the more consecutive wins he had, the more dangerous it would be.

The most important reason for Ah Huang’s profit deduction and Xu Tui’s choice was that he could bet and obtain additional income.

Of course, he would be betting on himself. The profits of betting on others depended purely on luck and whether there were shady dealings.

However, Xu Tui had the upper hand if he bet on himself.

“Brother Xu, there are two ways to place a bet here. The first is to directly use your own personal account to place a bet. The proceeds will be transferred directly into your account. Furthermore, when you transfer the money, the tax will be deducted according to the rules when you open a bank in your personal account.

“The advantage was that it was relatively safe. The only disadvantage was that there was no privacy. Whether it was here or inside the Huaxia Sector, everyone would know about your situation.

“Including the nickname Huang Tianba that you used,” Zhuang Ziqiang said.

“And the second option?”

It was his duty to pay taxes. However, if he used his personal account to transfer the money, he would not have any privacy here or in the Huaxia Sector. This was something that Xu Tui did not like.

“The second way is the anonymous trading cards for people who care about privacy. You can transfer your bet funds into the anonymous trading card. Then, you would use the anonymous trading card to bet on the profits.

“An anonymous trading card could be used in Sea Paradise. However, after leaving the Sea Paradise, such as returning to the Huaxia Sector, basically all the shops could not be used.

“You had to take the anonymous trading card to the bank where your personal account was. The anonymous trading card produced by Sea Paradise is universal and legal on the entire Blue Star.

“But you’ll still have to pay taxes when you put it into your personal account.”

At this point, Zhuang Ziqiang paused for a moment and said, “Comparatively speaking, it’s more convenient to use an anonymous trading card, but it’s not as safe. Customers with anonymous trading cards are easy targets.”

Xu Tui could not help but recall the last part of the safety assessment that Ah Huang had provided him when he had just arrived at the Sea Paradise.

“I’ll use the anonymous trading card.” Xu Tui immediately made a decision. “Also, you can use the anonymous trading card. I came with you. I’ve revealed all of my identity information. There’s no value in me using you,” Xu Tui said.

“Brother Xu, don’t worry. We liked to use anonymous trading cards the most when we were running those things previously. It’s just that they have always been very secretive. However, as long as you win a few rounds in a row today, you would immediately attract the attention of some people. You could not keep a low profile.

“By the way, Brother Xu, how much are you prepared to bet?”

Zhuang Ziqiang had come over with an anonymous trading card and a card reader. It was obvious that he had predicted Xu Tui’s choice.

“A million.”

This number shocked Zhuang Ziqiang. “Damn, Brother Xu, are you that rich?”

In Zhuang Ziqiang’s eyes, Xu Tui was just a student. His performance had always been a little stingy. It was good enough that he had hundreds of thousands yuan. He did not expect him to bet a million.

“The school gave me some bonuses from the actual combat exchange that day. This is all I have,” Xu Tui said.

“Brother Xu, if you don’t leave some, what if…”

“There are no what-ifs.”

“Alright.” Zhuang Ziqiang nodded. “Then I’ll bet with Brother Xu. 500,000.”

Of course, Zhuang Ziqiang had more than that. However, as a businessman, he would not risk everything. Most importantly, he had come many times. He had seen too many accidents in the regular arena of Sea Paradise.

“Brother Xu, let’s make it clear first. You need to know when to stop. You can’t go all out. If you encounter an opponent too strong, just admit defeat. It’s just a deposit or something. There are plenty of opportunities. There’s no need to risk your life.” Zhuang Ziqiang said.

“I understand. Thank you!”

….

Today was the weekend. According to Zhuang Ziqiang, there were a few more people in Sea Paradise than usual.

It was not even six o’clock yet, but the 100 VIP tickets, 1,000 seats, and 2,000 standing tickets in the regular arena had already been sold out. The entire regular arena was bustling with noise.

The regular arena had a three-dimensional design. In the middle was a medium-sized arena that was 60 meters long and 40 meters wide.

In order to prevent the audience from being hurt, the arena was half-sealed. There were high-intensity transparent glass walls around it.

The best seats for viewing were naturally the seats above. Of course, they were also the most expensive seats.

According to Zhuang Ziqiang, the starting price of a VIP ticket was 12,888 yuan, the price of the seating area is from 1,088 to 6,888 yuan, and the price for one standing ticket is 588 yuan.

Anyway, according to Zhuang Ziqiang, this thing was a money-making machine. Even though the admission fee was five to six million yuan a night. The admission fee was the lowest. Betting and trading with all kinds of additional value was the real deal. So it was hard to get a ticket during the weekend.

It couldn’t be helped. No performance could compare to this kind of realistic and bloody combat. This was the most realistic movie-level battle scene.

You can see what you can and cannot think of here.

At six o’clock, the regular arena matches officially began.

According to the rules of the arena here, the first round would be the newcomer competition. They were newbies who had never participated in a competition here. They would write their numbers on the ball and place them in the pool.

They would randomly draw two challengers each time.

Those who won would continue to fight with a winning record. Those who lost could also fight again. However, once they lost three times in a row, they would forever lose the right to participate in the battle.

There were a total of 21 newcomers who signed up today.

One of them would get a bye.

However, the rules here were crueler.

The bye was not luck. That person would not have any chance to fight today. He could either leave or wait until tomorrow.

Each match could not last more than ten minutes. Those who could not determine a winner within ten minutes would be judged as losers. Before each match began, the audience would be given three minutes to place their bets. The bets were also made directly through the betting machines in front of them. It was very simple and convenient.

The first match was between Number Four and Number Nine.

The big screen did not reveal any useful information. It only showed their age.

Number Four was 24 years old, and Number Nine was 28 years old.

At the start, the number of bets jumped crazily. In just two minutes, more than 50 million were bet on these two contestants.

Xu Tui was a little shocked when he saw this. Moreover, the number of bets was still climbing.

“Whether it’s the organizers or the audience, they don’t have any information about the two sides of the competition. Therefore, a portion of the true gamblers like them. It’s purely a matter of luck,” Zhuang Ziqiang said.

However, Xu Tui felt that it was not entirely a matter of luck. At least from his observation.

The two of them should be cultivators of the Extreme Branch.

Number Four looked even more majestic and had stronger limbs. The odds of winning were slightly higher now, so the odds were slightly lower. It was about 1:1.35, and the odds were still dropping.

Number Nine’s figure was more well-proportioned. He looked very ordinary, but the lines on his body were more defined. In Xu Tui’s opinion, Number Nine should be more well-rounded.

However, Number Nine’s win rate was low, so the odds were higher. It was 1:1.65, and it was still rising.

Xu Tui felt that Number Nine might win in the end.

Three minutes passed quickly.

Number Four’s bet had exceeded 100 million, and the odds had become lower.

The battle was also carried out amidst impassioned chants and shouts.

Number Four and Number Nine were both Extreme Branch cultivators. From the beginning, their punches hit flesh. 30 seconds into the battle, blood flew everywhere.

The battle ended after a minute.

Number Four won.

Cheers filled the air. There were all sorts of profanities mixed in with the cheers. There were even people who roared throughout the venue.

“I’ll pay a million to buy Number Nine to continue fighting. Let this trash die!”

Many people clamored like this, but the organizers would not be affected by it.

Xu Tui frowned slightly. His prediction had been wrong. Of course, this was not unusual. He had just started training his eyesight.

However, why did Number Nine, whom he thought will win, lose?

Xu Tui recalled the scene of the two of them fighting just now and fell into deep thought.

There was knowledge everywhere in life.

In actual combat, it was also a form of knowledge to judge the strength of others by observing and studying their external performance. The more he accumulated, the more precious his knowledge became.

More importantly, at this moment, Ah Huang, an advanced artificial intelligence supercomputer, had also taken the opportunity to analyze the battle just now for Xu Tui.

“Actually, Number Nine’s overall strength is indeed a little stronger. However, look at how Number Nine held back when he attacked. On the other hand, Number Four was fighting with all his might. But look at his second attack. If…”

Compared to Xu Tui’s own analysis, Ah Huang’s supercomputer analysis was extremely detailed.

There were many things that Xu Tui did not expect Ah Huang to point out. Xu Tui was stunned when he heard that. He improved at lightning speed.

Zhuang Ziqiang did not quite understand Xu Tui’s concentration. What was he thinking?

Xu Tui had been extremely focused during the past few matches. It was as if he was attending a class. His emotions were not affected by the audience at all.

But he had cheered several times.

This was strange! Why did he watch the competition for fun?

“The sixth match, No. 5 Night Wolf versus No. 17 Huang Tianba!”

Two balls flew out of the pool. The broadcast sounded at the same time. Zhuang Ziqiang was about to remind Xu Tui when he realized that Xu Tui had already stood up.
